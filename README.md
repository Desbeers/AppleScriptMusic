#  SwiftUI Music Remote with AppleScript

A 'proof of concept' how to control Music on macOS with a SwiftUI application using the `AppleScriptObjC` and `iTunesLibrary` frameworks.

Goal is to make it as *Swiftly* as possible.

Very much based on [Swift-AppleScriptObjC](https://github.com/hhas/Swift-AppleScriptObjC)
